# Optimization for Engineers - Dr.Johannes Hild
# projected Newton descent

# Purpose: Find xmin to satisfy norm(xmin - P(xmin - gradf(xmin)))<=eps
# Iteration: x_k = P(x_k + t_k * d_k)
# d_k is the Newton direction of the reduced hessian if it satisfies a descent direction check, otherwise choose d_k to be the steepest descent.
# t_k results from projected backtracking

# Input Definition:
# f: objective class with methods .objective() and .gradient() and .hessian()
# P: box projection class with method .project() and .activeIndexSet()
# x0: column vector in R ** n(domain point)
# eps: tolerance for termination. Default value: 1.0e-3
# verbose: bool, if set to true, verbose information is displayed

# Output Definition:
# xmin: column vector in R ** n(domain point)

# Required files:
# d = PrecCGSolver(A,b) from PrecCGSolver.py
# t = projectedBacktrackingSearch(f, P, x, d) from projectedBacktrackingSearch.py

# Test cases:
# p = np.array([[1], [1]])
# myObjective = simpleValleyObjective(p)
# a = np.array([[1], [1]])
# b = np.array([[2], [2]])
# myBox = projectionInBox(a, b)
# x0 = np.array([[2], [2]], dtype=float)
# eps = 1.0e-3
# xmin = projectedNewtonDescent(myObjective, myBox, x0, eps, 1)
# should return xmin close to [[1],[1]]

# myObjective = nonlinearObjective()
# a = np.array([[1], [1]])
# b = np.array([[2], [2]])
# myBox = projectionInBox(a, b)
# x0 = np.array([[0.1], [0.1]], dtype=float)
# eps = 1.0e-3
# xmin = projectedNewtonDescent(myObjective, myBox, x0, eps, 1)
# should return xmin close to [[1],[1]]

# myObjective = nonlinearObjective()
# a = np.array([[-2], [-2]])
# b = np.array([[2], [2]])
# myBox = projectionInBox(a, b)
# x0 = np.array([[1.5], [2]], dtype=float)
# eps = 1.0e-3
# xmin = projectedNewtonDescent(myObjective, myBox, x0, eps, 1)
# should return xmin close to [[-0.26],[0.21]] (if it is close to [[0.26],[-0.21]] then maybe your reduction is done wrongly)

# myObjective = bananaValleyObjective()
# a = np.array([[-10], [-10]])
# b = np.array([[10], [10]])
# myBox = projectionInBox(a, b)
# x0 = np.array([[0], [1]], dtype=float)
# eps = 1.0e-6
# xmin = projectedNewtonDescent(myObjective, myBox, x0, eps, 1)
# should return xmin close to [[1],[1]] in less than 25 iterations. If you have too much iterations, then maybe the hessian is used wrongly.
